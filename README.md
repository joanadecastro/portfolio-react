## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

This project is built using the following frontend technologies and tools:

### 1. React
- Description**: JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces.
- **Features**:
  - **Reusable Components**: Facilitates modular UI development and maintenance.
  - JSX**: Syntax that allows writing HTML declaratively within JavaScript.
  - Virtual DOM**: Improves performance by updating only the necessary parts of the UI.

### 2. JavaScript (ES6+)
- Description**: Programming language that adds logic and dynamism to the frontend.
- **Features**:
  - Use of modern syntax (ES6+) such as **arrow functions**, **destructuring**, and **spread operator** for clearer and more efficient code.
  - Support for asynchronous programming with `async/await` and `promises`.

### 3. HTML5
- Description**: Markup language that structures the content of the application.
- **Features**:
  - **Semantic tags**: Improves accessibility and SEO of the project.
  - Integration with React**: Defines the base structure on which the components are assembled.

### 4. CSS3
- Description**: Styling language for the visual design of the application.
- **Features**:
  - **Flexbox and Grid**: Used for responsive layout design.
  - Animations and Transitions**: Adds visual effects that enhance the user experience.
  - Media Queries**: Adapt the interface to different screen sizes.

### 5. Libraries and Additional Tools
- React Hooks**: `useState`, `useRef`, etc., used to manage state and effects in components.
- Node.js and npm**: Node.js as development environment and npm as package manager to install dependencies and additional tools.


This project leverages these technologies to provide a fast, modern and responsive user experience.
